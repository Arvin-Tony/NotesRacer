NotesRacer – Objectives, Phases, & Layout

Objectives/Phases:
Main objective: Create a tool to help students to study in a fun manner while honing their typing skills.
Phases:
1.	Create a typing game in which you can input your notes/definitions, and type them out (start out by making it possible to copy paste your notes)
2.	Race yourself – practice on notes and see your typing speeds (involves account creation, storing data)
3.	Upload notes in PDF or even PPT format
4.	Create ‘study sessions’ which are collections of notes-prompts that should be done together and will be typed one after another
5.	Have friends join locally – race them on the notes, they would need a link to join
6.	Implement a feature in which after the user types out the prompt, the prompt is hidden and the user must then type out what they recall – this will then be compared to the original prompt using the ChatGPT API, and then scored. Feedback will be provided on what details were missed.
7.	Create ‘test sessions’ in which notes-prompts from a ‘study session’ are immediately followed by the feature in Phase 6
8.	Create shared ‘test sessions’ that friends can race together locally on
9.	Create non-local racing capability (race with anyone)
10.	More to come…
